**The Ultimate Mod Management Tool for Geometry Dash**

Denabler is a lightweight utility mod that lets you quickly disable all other mods (and re-enable them) so you can speedrun, test, or enjoy a clean experience without manually toggling every mod. 

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **One-Click Management**: Instantly disable or enable all your mods with a single button
- **Smart Protection**: Automatically preserves the mod loader (Geode) and Denabler itself
- **Perfect for Speedrunning**: Quickly switch to a clean game state for competitive runs
- **Testing Friendly**: Easily isolate issues by disabling all mods at once
- **Clean Experience**: Enjoy vanilla Geometry Dash without losing your mod setup

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

Access Denabler through the convenient button in the main menu's bottom bar. Click it to reveal two options:
- **Enable All**: Brings back all your previously disabled mods
- **Disable All**: Safely disables all mods while keeping Geode and Denabler active

## ðŸš€ Future Features

- **Mod Preservation System**: Ability to mark specific mods as "protected" so they won't be disabled
- **Custom Profiles**: Save different mod configurations for different purposes
- **Advanced Settings**: More granular control over which mods get affected

By default, there's an option in settings to also disable the main mod if you really want to go completely vanilla.
